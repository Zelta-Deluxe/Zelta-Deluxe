Don't expect to find general information here. Just my coding stuff.

## ðŸ‘¾ About me
Hey. I'm Zelta, a game developer that focuses on programming.
I usually code mods, but right now I'm starting to code my original games.
To execute my projects I usually code with **Lua**, but I'm learning object oriented programming with **Haxe** and to emulate that type of language with **LÃ¶ve**, a **Lua** framework.

## ðŸ’¡ My ideas
Right now I'm thinking on a lot of projects. I think I'll make some kind of **public Trello** board with my ideas and projects, some list where you can know what's next with me. My main goals are a magical themed platformer game called **Star Land** and some **psychological horror** games, cuz' I like spooky. Also, I love **pixel art**, both in two dimensions and three dimensions, so my projects may have that aesthetic.
